### Rushhour - The Game

A simple webapp of Rushhourâ„¢ The Game. Writen in pure Javascript (without any dependencies) with about 250 lines of code. (Core game without arrows and confetti under 200 lines (look at the first commit))

#### How to play?
Just click on the arrows which appear if you hover above a car/truck and the vehicle moves in that direction.

#### Possible TODOS
- [x] On hover two arrows pop up so the user knows where to click exactly
- [x] Add sounds and music
- [x] Add confetti if the user won
- [ ] Add pictures for the cars
- [ ] Add more level and a level selection (currently implemented 4 different level)
- [ ] Implement a leaderboard
- [ ] Fix the confetti animation
